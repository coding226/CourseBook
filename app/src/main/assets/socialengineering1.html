<p><strong><em>They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but it&rsquo;s not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>What is Social Engineering?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Social Engineering is a behavior that involves humans convincing other individuals to perform actions they would not normally do.</p>
<p><strong>Background info:</strong></p>
<p>Computer Security is becoming more advanced, and with the use of e-mails, Web 2.0 services such as Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites in our daily business communication. Employees are expected to be educated and implement security on their own devices either in the work office or at home.&nbsp; The development of organizations' data access and cloud services has brought a model transfer in file sharing and communication which would be conducted by third parties. For this reason, employees with low-security knowledge and privacy should be educated.</p>
<p>Social engineering is a type of art where users get compromised to information systems. This means humans trick other humans to access a company's information. These attacks will not be stopped by technical protections only, but with measures that allow employees to detect them.</p>
