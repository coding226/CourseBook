<p><u>Introduction: </u></p>
<p><strong><em>They say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, but it&rsquo;s not one half so bad as a lot of ignorance.</em></strong></p>
<p>&mdash;Terry Pratchett</p>
<p><strong>What is Social Engineering?&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>Social Engineering is a behavior that involves humans convincing other individuals to perform actions they would not normally do.</p>
<p><strong>Background info:</strong></p>
<p>Computer Security is becoming more advanced, and with the use of e-mails, Web 2.0 services such as Twitter, Facebook, and other social media sites in our daily business communication. Employees are expected to be educated and implement security on their own devices either in the work office or at home.&nbsp; The development of organizations' data access and cloud services has brought a model transfer in file sharing and communication which would be conducted by third parties. For this reason, employees with low-security knowledge and privacy should be educated.</p>
<p>Social engineering is a type of art where users get compromised to information systems. This means humans trick other humans to access a company's information. These attacks will not be stopped by technical protections only, but with measures that allow employees to detect them.</p>
<p>Topic1:<u> Types of Social Engineering:</u></p>
<p>There are different types of social engineering attacks and they all get performed in different ways, depending on the attacker's way.</p>
<p><strong>Physical social engineering attack </strong></p>
<p>When Attackers gain access physically to an important office of a company or an organization. This could be done by :</p>
<ol>
<li>Pretending to be someone from within the company and authorized access to the location.</li>
<li>Tailgating &ndash; Following someone without them knowing or it could be by the following someone by the person's knowledge or permission.</li>
<li>If the physical security is weak. Social engineers could disable CCTV systems or pass fingerprint scanners using different methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a physical social engineer will be seen in the next topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remote Social Engineering</strong></p>
<p>When Attackers gain access to information or resources remotely. For example via the phone, email, instant messaging, or even fax machines.</p>
<p>Examples in the next topic.</p>
<p><strong>Combination Attack</strong></p>
<p>This involves combining both physical and remote attacks for example this could be a</p>
<ul>
<li>Boy Who Cries Wolf Attack</li>
</ul>
<p>This is when guards think the attack is not real and don&rsquo;t bother to respond. They have been <strong>socially engineered</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Road Apples</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a physical object such as a USB or even a CD that social engineers leave in the victim's office, organization, or even in a caf&eacute;. SEs hope that one of the staff members picks it up and plugs it in their own or companies device. This object could be harmful and because of staff curiosity, he/she has been socially engineered to plug in an unknown object that could be malicious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Topic2: <u>Social Engineering Nowadays</u></p>
<p>This topic explains examples of social engineering attacks that are being performed nowadays.</p>
<p>The first type example is based on physical social engineering attacks those are called:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dumpster Diving</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This attack involves a person going through a company's trash can to get sensitive information that could be used by an attacker. This information could be a password or pieces of code that the attacker could use for malicious purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Distraction Attacks</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Distraction involves a group of social engineers that works together to distract security guards or important people to sneak into buildings and rooms. Nowadays, it is easy to communicate with security guards and gain their friendship and trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second type example is based on remote social engineering those could happen on:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>By Email</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Email SE involves sending a phishing email (explained more in malware course) to users/employees to trick them to click on a fake website that looks well-known or asks them to call back using a telephone number. The attacker's main aim is to gain personal information such as bank numbers, account numbers, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>By Phone</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This action is similar to the above, but with calling the victim and gaining sensitive information. Or sometimes Social engineers will convince users to visit a certain website or a system.</li>
<li>The caller will fake his/her identity and may use various ways to convince the victim, this could be by being friendly or acting authoritatively, or also applying pressure on you.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>By mumble attack</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This attack is done via a telephone which is targeted at call center agents.</li>
<li>This is done by SE possessing a speech-impaired customer.</li>
<li>Victims may feel embarrassed and release sensitive information.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Topic 3: <u>Reconnaissance</u></p>
<p>This is a practice of gaining and discovering information about a system.</p>
<p>Intelligence Collection Disciplines (INTs): way if collecting that information is by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human: This is collected by humans either by interviewing a person or covertly. This involves listening to someone talking about something important without them knowing.</li>
<li>OSINT open-source intelligence. This involves collecting data from open sources such as social media or form public data</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employees should be careful from what they post because social engineers perform Reconnaissance, which involves gathering three types of information that will be needed to create a social engineer scenario. A scenario may involve that the attacker gains information about the company that seems realistic and may succeed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Effective social engineers involve gathering all pieces of information like a puzzle that allows them to attack the target successfully.</p>
