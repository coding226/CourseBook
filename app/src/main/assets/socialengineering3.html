This topic explains examples of social engineering attacks that are being performed nowadays.

The first type example is based on physical social engineering attacks those are called:

Dumpster Diving
This attack involves a person going through a company's trash can to get sensitive information that could be used by an attacker. This information could be a password or pieces of code that the attacker could use for malicious purposes.

Distraction Attacks
Distraction involves a group of social engineers that works together to distract security guards or important people to sneak into buildings and rooms. Nowadays, it is easy to communicate with security guards and gain their friendship and trust.

The second type example is based on remote social engineering those could happen on:

By Email
Email SE involves sending a phishing email (explained more in malware course) to users/employees to trick them to click on a fake website that looks well-known or asks them to call back using a telephone number. The attacker's main aim is to gain personal information such as bank numbers, account numbers, and so on.
By Phone
This action is similar to the above, but with calling the victim and gaining sensitive information. Or sometimes Social engineers will convince users to visit a certain website or a system.
The caller will fake his/her identity and may use various ways to convince the victim, this could be by being friendly or acting authoritatively, or also applying pressure on you.
By mumble attack
This attack is done via a telephone which is targeted at call center agents.
This is done by SE possessing a speech-impaired customer.
