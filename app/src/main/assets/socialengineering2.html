<p>There are different types of social engineering attacks and they all get performed in different ways, depending on the attacker's way.</p>
<p><strong>Physical social engineering attack </strong></p>
<p>When Attackers gain access physically to an important office of a company or an organization. This could be done by :</p>
<ol>
    <li>Pretending to be someone from within the company and authorized access to the location.</li>
    <li>Tailgating &ndash; Following someone without them knowing or it could be by the following someone by the person's knowledge or permission.</li>
    <li>If the physical security is weak. Social engineers could disable CCTV systems or pass fingerprint scanners using different methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a physical social engineer will be seen in the next topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remote Social Engineering</strong></p>
<p>When Attackers gain access to information or resources remotely. For example via the phone, email, instant messaging, or even fax machines.</p>
<p>Examples in the next topic.</p>
<p><strong>Combination Attack</strong></p>
<p>This involves combining both physical and remote attacks for example this could be a</p>
<ul>
    <li>Boy Who Cries Wolf Attack</li>
</ul>
<p>This is when guards think the attack is not real and don&rsquo;t bother to respond. They have been <strong>socially engineered</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Road Apples</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a physical object such as a USB or even a CD that social engineers leave in the victim's office, organization, or even in a caf&eacute;. SEs hope that one of the staff members picks it up and plugs it in their own or companies device. This object could be harmful and because of staff curiosity, he/she has been socially engineered to plug in an unknown object that could be malicious.</p>
